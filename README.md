# CompSci-Competitions
A collection of competition projects I have attended, practiced with, or both. Includes both UIL and CodeWars practice.


I may not be the author of some of the code, as for some I just uploaded competition code. Competitions are done on a team of three, so even if it has an '@author Andrew' tag, it may be written by someone else. I also include my times for some of the problems, and the difficulty of each competition varies.
